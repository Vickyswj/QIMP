# Formalizing the Semantics of a Classical-Quantum Imperative Language in Coq

## Overview


We define the syntax, small-step operational semantics and state-based denotational semantics of a classical-quantum imperative language. In addition, we prove the consistency of these two semantics.  
We lift the denotational semantics from states to distributions and relate the latter to the former. Furthermore, we formalize some practical quantum algorithms and use the distribution-based denotational semantics to prove their correctness.


We describe it in detail in [this draft](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11023).
